# XcodeMigrate

Generate Bazel BUILD files from Xcode projects.

Long term plans:

- Generate Buck files
- Generate Xcodegen YAML files

This project is still in its early stages. It is not yet ready for production use.

## Goals

- Easy and quick setup process for most projects
- Full support [rules_xcodeproj](https://github.com/buildbuddy-io/rules_xcodeproj)
- Mixed language target (Objective-C/Swift) generation using [rules_ios](https://github.com/bazel-ios/rules_ios)

## Design

- End-to-end testing with Xcode projects generated by Tuist
- Decoupling Xcode project parser and generator
